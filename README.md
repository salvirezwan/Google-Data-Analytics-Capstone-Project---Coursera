# Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone-Project---Coursera
This is the case study that I worked on as part of the 8th course of Coursera's Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate series. I was given a case study regarding fitness activities. I implemented my analysis using Python on Google Collab and produced a final report.
